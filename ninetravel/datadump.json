International and domestic flights are both covered also. Their site also offers a useful price graph to determine which day is the cheapest, although its results do vary. You can also set multiple destinations and see which is the cheapest which is definitely a cool feature, but as with above, it\u2019s not 100% accurate. Searching via the map is a another nifty feature if you have a budget but don\u2019t know where you can fly with it.. When booking a return flight Trip.com has recently added the option to select first the outbound leg and then the return leg, or to select them both at the same time with the \u201cSwitch Selection Mode\u201d feature.  Once rather peculiar feature that they have are \u201clate-issued\u201d tickets, which can be issued any time up to 72 hours before a flight. They are guaranteed to be issued, so you aren\u2019t taking much of a risk, however they can be unnerving. In our own experience, they are actually usually issued much quicker, in fact when we book one it was issued within a few hours. Regardless, these tickets are always clearly marked as such so the choice is always yours. In the plus side, this kind of ticket is usually excellently priced.", "descpricingcontent": "If you search on comparison sites like Skyscanner, you\u2019ll find that Trip.com has some very competitive prices for flights.

There is no booking fee or credit card fees when booking with Trip.com They don\u2019t charge extra for changes and cancellations, they simply pass on the cost that the airline or their supplier charges them. As with most OTA\u2019s, make sure to pay attention to the change and cancellation charges before booking as they might not be in line with the airline\u2019s own charges. Generally speaking though, Trip.com does quite a good job at outlining these fees up front.

One great option that is visible on many flights is seat selection, as this can be done prior to making your booking, whereas with many other competitors you can only do it afterwards \u2013 this of course is airline dependent. One massive disadvantage to booking flights on Agoda is that from our testing, they don\u2019t display any useful information at all about baggage and change and cancellation fees \u2013 simply directing you to the airline\u2019s websites.

Create a new Django project named dashboard and inside it create a new app named reports.\r\n\r\nTo install the package, run the following command:\r\n\r\npip install django-import-export\r\nThen, in your settings.py add your app name (reports) and import-export library into INSTALLED_APPS:\r\n\r\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\r\n    ...\r\n    'import_export',\r\n    'reports'\r\n)\r\nI also recommend to add optional configuration to end of settings.py:\r\n\r\nIMPORT_EXPORT_USE_TRANSACTIONS = True\r\nThe default value is False.
